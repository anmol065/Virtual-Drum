# Virtual-Drum
This is a JavaScript-based virtual drum that utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure and layout of the drum machine, the CSS is responsible for styling the buttons and animation, while the JavaScript code adds interactivity by adding event listeners to the buttons and the keyboard to play sounds and control the animations.
